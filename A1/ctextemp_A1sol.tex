\section{(Exercise 24.1)}

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item
Let $u_{1}$ be player $1'$s payoff function in $G$, and $v_{1}$ be
her payoff function in $G'$. According to the question statement,
for every action profile $(x,y)$ in $G$ and $G'$, $v_{1}(x,y)\geq
u_{1}(x,y)$. Suppose there are n action available to player $1$.
Then for each action $x_{i}$:
\begin{equation}\min_{y}v_{1}(x_{i},y)\geq \min_{y}u_{1}(x_{i},y) ,
i=1,2,\ldots,n
\end{equation}
Moreover:
\begin{equation}
\max_{x}\min_{y}v_{1}(x,y)\geq \max_{x}\min_{y}u_{1}(x,y)
\end{equation}
Since $\max_{x}\min_{y}v_{1}(x,y)$ is a maxminimizer for both
players in $G'$, which means
$v_{1}(x^*,y^*)=\max_{x}\min_{y}v_{1}(x,y)$, i.e. $(x^*,y^*)$ is the
\NE of $G'$. Similarly we got $(s^*,t^*)$, the \NE of $G$.Then we
got $v_1(x^*,y^*)\geq u_1(s^*,t^*)$, which means the Nash
Equilibrium in $G'$ is no worse than that in $G$.

\item
Let $u_1(x,y)$ be the first player's payoff function. Let $G'$ be
the game where one of player $1'$s action is deleted, i.e.
$(A_1)'\subseteq (A_1)$. The payoff function is the same. Let $X,X'$
the set produced by $\min_yu_1(x,y)$ in $G$ and $G'$. Then we got
$X'\subseteq X$,hence $\max(X')\leq \max(X)$. That is,
\begin{equation}
\max_{x\in (A_1)'}\min_yu_1(x,y)\leq \max_{x\in
(A_1)}\min_yu_1(x,y)\end{equation} (They are the \NE of $G$ and
$G'$.)

\item
For a, let $G$ and $G'$ be \\
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline
        & $y_1$ & $y_2$ \\
  \hline
  $x_1$ & (1,3) & (2,2) \\
  \hline
  $x_2$ & (2,2) & \textbf{(4,4)} \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline
        & $y_1$ & $y_2$ \\
  \hline
  $x_1$ & \textbf{(3,3)} & (5,2) \\
  \hline
  $x_2$ & (2,2) & (4,4) \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\]

The \NE is $(x_2,y_2)$. If we change $(x_1,y_1)$ to $(3,3)$,
$(x_1,y_2)$ to $(5,2)$ then the \NE is $(x_1,y_1)$ in $G'$, where
player 1 has a worse payoff 3 than the payoff 4 in $(x_2,y_2)$
of $G$.\\\\
For b, use the second table as $G$. If we prohibit player 1 from
using $x_1$, then $(x_2,y_2)=(4,4)$ is the \NE such that player 1
will have a higher payoff than the \NE in $G$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{(Exercise 35.1)}
Assume that there exists a mixed strategy \NE
$\alpha^*=(\alpha_i^*)$. For every player i, his action profile
$\alpha^*_1$ is in the form $(1(p_1^1),2(p_2^1)\ldots K(p_K^1))$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If other player's actions are fixed, player i can always
calculate and choose the action $x^*$ which is closest to 2/3 of

average as some other people may be, and this is his payoff, which
is greater than 0,or he gets payoff value 0.
\item Let $m^*$ be the largest number that has a probability greater
than 0 for player i in $\alpha_i^*$. Since for every action in the
support of his mixed strategy \NE, mixed strategy yields the same
payoff for him. Also the payoff should be positive because of (1).
When he chooses $m^*$, it means that he is using $m^*$ to achieve
the "closest to 2/3 of average" goal. Also there are some other
players who also choose $m^*$. Then these people as well as i get
the split prize. Others get 0.
\item If player i chooses $m^*$, he SHOULD choose $m^*-1$ in order to
get a better payoff because at that time he becomes the only one who
is closest to 2/3 average, and thus getting better payoff. However,
if he chooses $m^*-1$, others will also adjust their strategy to get
better payoff, which results an iterate decreasing of $m^*$, and
finally $m^*=1$ for all the players. Since we assume that $m^*$ is
the largest number that has a positive probability, the probability
of $m^*$ becomes 1 and we got the unique mixed strategy \NE in which
every player's strategy is pure.
\end{enumerate}
\section{(Exercise 94.2)}
Prove it as two parts.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Without loss of generality, let $(a'_1,a'_2)\sim_i (a'_1,a''_2)$ for
$i=1,2$. Let $u_i$ be their payoff function, then we got
$u_1(a'_1,a'_2)=u_1(a'_1,a''_2)$ and
$u_2(a'_1,a'_2)=u_2(a'_1,a''_2)$. Then we can construct a extensive
game with perfect information $\Gamma$.
\[
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
            & $a'_2$ & $a''_2$ \\\hline
    $a'_1$  & (1,2) & (1,2) \\\hline
    $a''_1$ & (3,4) & (5,6) \\\hline
    \end{tabular}
\]

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}

\caption{extensive game with perfect information construct from $G$}
\label{fig:extgame}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item
Suppose $G$ is the strategic form of an extensive game $\Gamma$ with
perfect information. There are only two strategy for each player in
the strategic form, and each strategy contains only one action,
which means that both player have only one chance to move on a
non-terminal history. Without loss of generality, let player 1 move
first. From the empty sequence, he could choose to play $a'_1$ or
$a''_1$. Because player 2 only have one chance to move on a
non-terminal history, say, $a''_1$, then player $1's$ action $a'_1$
leads to a terminal history, so the strategy profile between both
player yields the same outcome. Hence we got $(a'_1,a'_2)\sim_i
(a'_1,a''_2)$ for $i=1,2$ in  this case.
\end{enumerate}
By combining 1 and 2, we prove the if and only if statement. \\*
